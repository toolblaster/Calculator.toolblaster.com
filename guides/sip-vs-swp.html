            <h1>SIP vs. SWP: Building Your Wealth vs. Creating Your Paycheck</h1>
            <p>In the world of investing, SIP and SWP are two sides of the same coin. Think of your financial life like managing a reservoir. A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is the process of collecting rainwater, drop by drop, to fill the reservoir. A Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) is opening the tap to provide a steady stream of water when you need it. One is for accumulation, the other for distribution. Understanding when and how to use each is the key to a successful financial journey.</p>

                <h2>Pro-Tips for a Successful SWP</h2>
                <p>Setting up an SWP requires careful planning. Here are three key tips:</p>
                <ul class="icon-list">
                    <li>
                        <svg class="list-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M11 19a7 7 0 1 0 0-14 7 7 0 0 0 0 14z"/><path d="m21 21-4.3-4.3"/></svg>
                        <span><strong>Choose the Right Fund:</strong> An SWP is best suited for less volatile funds like hybrid or debt funds to ensure consistency in your income stream.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <svg class="list-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M12 22c5.523 0 10-4.477 10-10S17.523 2 12 2 2 6.477 2 12s4.477 10 10 10z"></path><path d="M12 16v-4l-2 2"/></svg>
                        <span><strong>Determine a Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR):</strong> A common rule of thumb is the 4% rule, but this can vary. Your SWR should ideally be lower than your fund's expected long-term return to prevent your corpus from depleting too quickly.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <svg class="list-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M2 3h6a4 4 0 0 1 4 4v14a3 3 0 0 0-3-3H2z"/><path d="M22 3h-6a4 4 0 0 0-4 4v14a3 3 0 0 1 3-3h7z"/></svg>
                        <span><strong>Review Annually:</strong> Review your SWP annually to account for inflation and market performance. You may need to adjust your withdrawal amount to ensure your corpus lasts as long as you need it to.</span>

                <h2>The Final Verdict: Two Tools for Two Different Jobs</h2>
                <p>It's a mistake to see SIP and SWP as competitors. They are complementary tools designed for different stages of your financial life. Use a SIP to diligently build your wealth during your working years. Then, deploy an SWP to intelligently create a sustainable income stream from that wealth when you need it. Master both, and you've mastered the art of long-term financial planning.</p>

                        <p>The main difference is the direction of cash flow. A SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is for investing money into a mutual fund at regular intervals to build wealth (accumulation phase). An SWP (Systematic Withdrawal Plan) is for withdrawing money from a mutual fund at regular intervals to create an income stream (distribution phase).</p>

                        <p>Yes, it's possible. For example, you could be running a SIP in an equity fund for your long-term retirement goal while simultaneously running an SWP from a debt fund to cover your current monthly expenses. They would just need to be in different mutual fund schemes or folios.</p>
