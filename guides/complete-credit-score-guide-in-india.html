                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What is a good credit score in India?</summary>
                        <p>In India, a credit score typically ranges from 300 to 900. A score of 750 or above is generally considered excellent and will make you eligible for the best loan and credit card offers. A score between 650 and 750 is good, while a score below 650 may make it difficult to get approved for credit.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How long does it take to improve a credit score?</summary>
                        <p>Improving a credit score is a gradual process. You can see positive changes within 6 to 12 months of consistent good financial behavior, such as paying all bills on time and reducing your credit card balances. Major negative events, like a loan default, can take several years to fully recover from.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Does checking my own credit score lower it?</summary>
                        <p>No, checking your own credit score is considered a 'soft inquiry' and has no impact on your score. It's a common myth. In fact, you are encouraged to check your score regularly to monitor your financial health. A 'hard inquiry,' which occurs when a lender checks your score for a loan application, can cause a small, temporary negative impact.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What's the difference between CIBIL score and credit score?</summary>
                        <p>"Credit score" is the general term for the 3-digit number that rates your creditworthiness. "CIBIL score" is the specific brand name for the credit score provided by TransUnion CIBIL, which is the oldest and most well-known credit bureau in India. While other bureaus like Experian and Equifax also provide credit scores, the term "CIBIL score" is often used interchangeably with "credit score" in India.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Can I have a credit score if I've never taken a loan or credit card?</summary>
                        <p>No. If you have no credit history (no loans or credit cards), the credit bureaus will have no data to score. In this case, your score will typically be "NA" or "NH," which means "Not Applicable" or "No History." While this isn't a bad score, it can sometimes make it difficult to get your first loan or credit card as lenders have no record of your repayment behavior.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How do I fix errors on my credit report?</summary>
                        <p>If you find an error on your credit report (like a loan you never took or an incorrect late payment), you should immediately raise a dispute with the credit bureau that issued the report (e.g., CIBIL, Experian). They have a formal dispute resolution process on their website. You'll need to provide evidence to support your claim. The bureau will then verify the information with the lender and correct your report if the error is confirmed.</p>
