                <h2>Credit Score Myths vs. Realities</h2>
                <p>There's a lot of misinformation out there about credit scores. Let's clear up a few common myths that could be holding you back.</p>
                <div class="space-y-4 mt-4">
                    <div>
                        <h4><strong>Myth:</strong> You need to have debt to build a credit score.</h4>
                        <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Not at all. You don't need to pay interest to build a score. You simply need to use a credit product and pay it off responsibly. Using a credit card for your regular monthly spending and paying the bill in full before the due date is one of the best ways to build a strong score without ever paying a rupee in interest.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4><strong>Myth:</strong> Closing old, unused credit cards is good for your score.</h4>
                        <p><strong>Reality:</strong> This is one of the most damaging myths. Closing an old card actually hurts your score in two ways: it shortens the average age of your credit history and it increases your overall credit utilization ratio, both of which are negative signals to lenders.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4><strong>Myth:</strong> A high income automatically means a high credit score.</h4>
                        <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Your salary is not a direct factor in your credit score calculation. A person with a modest income who pays all their bills on time will have a much better score than a high-earner who is frequently late with payments.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What is considered a good credit score in India?</summary>
                        <p>In the Indian context, credit scores range from 300 to 900. A score of 750 or higher is widely regarded as excellent, significantly improving your chances for loan and credit card approvals at favorable terms. Scores from 650 to 750 are considered good, while those below 650 may face challenges in securing credit.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How quickly can I see an improvement in my credit score?</summary>
                        <p>Improving a credit score is a marathon, not a sprint. With consistent, positive financial habits—like timely bill payments and reduced credit card balances—you can expect to see noticeable improvements within 6 to 12 months. However, recovering from significant negative marks, such as a loan default, can take several years.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Will checking my own credit score harm it?</summary>
                        <p>This is a common myth. When you check your own score, it's a 'soft inquiry' and has zero impact on your credit score. It's actually a healthy financial habit to review your report regularly. A 'hard inquiry,' which is when a lender pulls your report for a loan application, can cause a minor, temporary dip in your score.</p>
