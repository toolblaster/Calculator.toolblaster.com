                <h2>📱 The Mobile App Face-Off</h2>
                <p>In an era where most retail investing happens on the go, the quality of the mobile app is paramount. A seamless mobile experience can be the deciding factor.</p>

                        <span><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong> Upstox generally wins here with a cleaner, more minimalist design that is very easy for beginners to pick up. 5paisa's app is feature-rich but can feel slightly more cluttered due to the sheer number of services it offers.</span>

                        <span><strong>Speed & Stability:</strong> Both apps are well-optimized, but users often report that Upstox feels slightly faster and more responsive, especially during peak trading hours.</span>

                        <span><strong>Feature Parity:</strong> Upstox does a slightly better job of translating its powerful web features (like advanced charting) to its mobile app. 5paisa's app is comprehensive but some advanced research features are best accessed on the web.</span>
