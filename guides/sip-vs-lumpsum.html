            <h1>SIP vs. Lumpsum: The Ultimate Investment Showdown</h1>
            <p style="margin: 0 1.5rem 1rem 1.5rem;">Welcome, investor! You're facing one of the most common questions in the financial world: "Should I invest my money all at once (Lumpsum) or a little at a time (SIP)?" The truth is, there's no single right answer. Both are powerful strategies, but they suit different financial situations and personalities. Think of it as choosing your character in a game: are you the disciplined, steady climber or the bold, strategic leaper? Let's find out which one you are.</p>

                        <summary>Which gives higher returns: SIP or Lumpsum?</summary>
                        <p>Statistically, if the market goes up over the long term, a Lumpsum investment will generally yield higher absolute returns because the entire amount is invested from day one, benefiting fully from compounding. However, a SIP can provide better-annualized returns (IRR) if the market is volatile, as it averages out the purchase cost. Lumpsum offers a higher potential reward but also carries a higher risk of bad timing.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Can I switch from a SIP to a Lumpsum investment?</summary>
                        <p>You don't really "switch" between them. A SIP is a method of investing regularly. You can stop your SIP at any time and the money you've invested will remain in the fund. If you later receive a large sum of money, you can make a separate Lumpsum investment into the same fund or a different one.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What if I have a small lumpsum amount? Should I invest it at once?</summary>
                        <p>If you have a smaller lumpsum amount (e.g., ₹25,000 or ₹50,000) and a long investment horizon (5+ years), it's generally fine to invest it all at once. The risk of timing the market is less significant with smaller amounts. Alternatively, you could use a Systematic Transfer Plan (STP), where you place the lumpsum in a low-risk liquid fund and transfer smaller amounts into an equity fund over a few months.</p>
