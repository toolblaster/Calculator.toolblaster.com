                    <strong>Enter Your Monthly Investment:</strong> Start with the amount you plan to invest via SIP each month. Remember, consistency is key for wealth creation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Set Your Expected Return Rate:</strong> Equity mutual funds have historically delivered returns in the range of 12-15% p.a. over the long term. Enter a realistic rate based on your fund's category.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Define Your Investment Period:</strong> The longer your investment horizon, the more your money benefits from compounding. A period of 10+ years is ideal for equity SIPs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Crucial Step: Adjust for Inflation:</strong> Toggle on the "Adjust for Inflation" option. The historical average inflation rate in India is around 5-6%. Entering this gives you the "Real Value" of your corpus—the most important number for realistic financial planning.

                <h4>The Magic of Compounding</h4>
                <p>Compounding is when you earn returns not just on your principal investment, but also on the accumulated returns. Our calculator shows you how this magical effect accelerates your wealth growth over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-card">
                <h4>Rupee Cost Averaging</h4>
                <p>With SIPs, you invest a fixed amount regularly. This means you buy more units when the market is low and fewer when it's high. This averages out your purchase cost and reduces the risk of market timing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-card">
                <h4>The Impact of Inflation</h4>
                <p>Inflation is the rate at which the cost of living increases, reducing the purchasing power of your money. A corpus of ₹1 Crore in 20 years will not buy what ₹1 Crore buys today. Factoring this in is essential.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What is an SIP calculator with inflation adjustment?</summary>
                <p>An SIP calculator with inflation adjustment is a financial tool that not only projects the future value of your Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) but also shows you what that future value will be worth in today's terms. It accounts for the gradual decrease in the purchasing power of money over time, giving you a more realistic financial forecast.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Why is my inflation-adjusted return lower than the total value?</summary>
                <p>Your total value shows the absolute amount of money you'll have, while the inflation-adjusted return (or "real value") shows what that money can actually buy. Because prices of goods and services tend to rise over time due to inflation, the ₹10 Lakhs you have in the future will buy less than ₹10 Lakhs today. Our calculator shows you this important difference.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>How does this tool help in better financial planning?</summary>
                <p>By using a reliable SIP calculator with inflation adjusted returns, you can set more realistic financial goals. If you need a corpus that has the purchasing power of ₹1 Crore today for your retirement in 20 years, this tool will help you calculate the actual (higher) target amount you need to achieve, ensuring you are not under-prepared.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What is a good monthly SIP amount to start with?</summary>
                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer. A good starting point is to invest at least 10-15% of your monthly income. The most important thing is to start early and stay consistent, even with a small amount like ₹500 or ₹1000 per month.</p>
