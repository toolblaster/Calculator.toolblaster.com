            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What is an EMI?</summary>
                <p>EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is the fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. EMIs are used to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>How does prepayment help?</summary>
                <p>Making a prepayment means paying an amount over and above your regular EMI. This extra amount goes directly towards reducing your outstanding principal loan amount. A lower principal means you pay less interest over the remaining loan tenure, and you can pay off your loan much faster.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What is an amortization schedule?</summary>
                <p>An amortization schedule is a table detailing each periodic payment on a loan. It shows how much of each payment is applied to the interest and how much to the principal. It also shows the remaining loan balance after each payment.</p>
