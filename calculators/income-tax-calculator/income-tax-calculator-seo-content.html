                <h3>Old Regime</h3>
                <p>This traditional regime allows you to claim numerous deductions and exemptions (like 80C, HRA, LTA, etc.) to reduce your taxable income, but it comes with higher tax rates at certain income levels.</p>

                <h3>New Regime</h3>
                <p>This is a simplified regime with lower, more streamlined tax slabs. However, you must forgo most of the common tax deductions and exemptions available under the Old Regime.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Can I switch between the old and new regimes every year?</summary>
                <p>Yes, if you are a salaried individual without any business income, you have the flexibility to choose between the old and new tax regimes each financial year when you file your income tax return.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Is this tool better than an income tax calculator excel sheet?</summary>
                <p>While an income tax calculator excel sheet can be useful, our online tool offers significant advantages. It is updated automatically with the latest tax laws, prevents manual formula errors, and provides interactive features like sliders and instant visual feedback with charts, making the process faster, more accurate, and much more user-friendly.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What is the Standard Deduction?</summary>
                <p>The Standard Deduction is a flat deduction of ₹50,000 that salaried individuals and pensioners can claim from their gross salary, reducing their taxable income. As of the latest budget, this deduction is available under both the Old and New Tax Regimes.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>How does the Section 87A rebate work?</summary>
                <p>Section 87A provides a tax rebate to individuals with a net taxable income below a certain threshold. In the New Regime, if your taxable income is up to ₹7 lakh, the rebate makes your tax liability zero. In the Old Regime, the threshold is ₹5 lakh. This is why you might see 'No Tax' even if your income falls into a 5% slab.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Why is my tax not zero even though my income is below the rebate limit?</summary>
                <p>This usually happens because the rebate is calculated on your 'Net Taxable Income', not your 'Gross Salary'. For example, if your gross salary is ₹7.2 lakh and you have no deductions, your taxable income is above the ₹7 lakh threshold in the New Regime, so you have to pay tax. The calculator automatically applies the rebate where applicable.</p>
